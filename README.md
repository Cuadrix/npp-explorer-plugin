# npp-explorer-plugin
This is a modified version of the [Explorer] plugin for [Notepad++].

The goal was:
- to fix an annoying bug that caused the toolbar's tooltip of the plugin to display garbage text.
- make the fg/bg colors of the listview and the treeview in the plugin to always match the current Notepad++ theme.
